# Group Project: Moringa Library

This project is a React web application that allows users to browse through a list of books available in a library, like the books and add them into the Favorites Section, and add them to My Shelf Section.

## Introduction

This application is a group project aimed at putting into practice the fundamentals and concepts of React.js that we've learned so far during the week and to also enhance our teamwork skills.

The project involves the use of:

1. `useState` to initial and manage state in the application.
2. `useEffect` to fetch data from our [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/books).
3. `useContext` to access global state.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

-  Node.js v14 or later
-  npm v6 or later

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. View profiles of bots in the `Home` component.
3. To add a book to your shelf, click on the `more details` in the `BookCard` component. You will be navigated to a books details section. Click on the `Add to Favorites` button and the book will be added to the `MyShelf` component.
4. To favorite a book, click on the red "❤️" `button` in the `BookCard` component. The book will be liked and added to your favorites collection.
